read-csv

First task is to write a program that can read the CSV data from the file. Create a file named ```read_csv.c``` and write code which prompts the user to open a file and prints each line of the text file. It should output something similar to what is seen below.

```
Enter a filename: data.csv

Once you finish and your output looks similar to example above, it is time to add the file to the repository. To see the current status of the local repository, type ```git status```. You should see output similar to the following.
